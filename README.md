# NLP_Project

Global SQL - NLP Project

Overview
This project involves two distinct components:

Code 1: Translates multi-language text to English.
Code 2: Translates English text to SQL queries.

The output from Code 1 serves as the input for Code 2. The project utilizes a specific dataset for training and evaluation purposes.

Project Structure

Code 1:

Description: Accepts multi-language text and translates it to English.
